# TODO

- Luarocks
- Promote Worley noise example to a more general case in forma.subpattern
- Standardise examples a bit more 
- Consider generalising BSP to even-size partitions of any shape (not just
  rectangular sub-areas)

#### Computational geometry methods to consider implementing:

- Farthest-first traversal
- Isoline drawing (mask-then-surface)
- Boundary/contour tracing in place of pattern.edge or pattern.surface
