# TODO

- Add a sampling example (random, voronoi relax, farthest-first)
- Decouple a bit pattern methods from the underlying data structure
- Standardise examples a bit more 
- Consider generalising BSP to even-size paritions of any shape (not just
  rectangular sub-areas)

#### Computational geometry methods to consider implementing:

- Farthest-first traversal
- Poisson-disc sampling
- Marching squares (or something else to draw isolines)
  Might be useful to explain 'categories' a bit better
- Boundary/contour tracing in place of pattern.edge or pattern.surface
